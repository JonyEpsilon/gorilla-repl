- Change bracket match highlighting to improve visibility.

## Version 0.3.1

- Generate suggested ns declaration in new file (thanks to @gfredericks and @modellurgist).
- Fix a bug when outputting 'list-like' values.

  consistent.
- Command to reset worksheet.
- Project is shown in title bar. Makes it easier to work with multiple Gorilla sessions.
- Prints a message if a newer version is available.
- URL shows filename, and can load worksheet from URL (thanks to @gfredericks and @modellurgist).
- New UI for commands and loading files. Mouse-friendly, small-screen friendlier, and generally less shoddy.

- Incanter integration https://github.com/JonyEpsilon/incanter-gorilla .

### Breaking changes

- Vega data now uses keywords rather than strings as keys (thanks to @cldellow). This will break any functions written
  to directly manipulate Vega structures. Value copy of Vega structures from old worksheets will also break.
- Change the gorilla-plot.core/histogram option fillOpacity to fill-opacity.

## Version 0.2.0

- All new renderer. This is the main change. The new renderer is simple and predictable, _very_ flexible, supports
  first-class pluggable custom rendering, and really respects the structure of Clojure values. In particular it renders
  aggregates of values as you might hope, so you can draw lists of tables, tables of plots, associatives of tables of
  tables of plots etc.
- You can open multiple tabs on the same REPL. This works really nicely - they each get they own session, but share the
  REPL.
- Runs a real nREPL server now, so should work together with things like vim-fireplace that make their own connection
  to the REPL server. (I haven't tested this though!)
- There's now a website. http://gorilla-repl.org
- Numerous small bug-fixes and feature requests.

### Breaking changes

- Old worksheets will need to be re-run to regenerate their output.
- Code that dabbled with the internals of gorilla-plot might need to be adjusted.
