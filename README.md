# Gorilla REPL

Gorilla is a rich REPL for Clojure in the notebook style. If you're interested you should take a look at its
[website](http://gorilla-repl.org).

This fork separates the nrepl related stuff you need to include in your project from the actual GoriallaREPL app code
which relies on a nrepl being present.
