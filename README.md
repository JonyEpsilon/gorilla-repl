# Gorilla REPL

Gorilla is a rich REPL for Clojure in the notebook style. If you're interested you should take a look at its
[website](http://gorilla-repl.org).

## Contributing

Contributions, in the form of comments, criticism, bug reports, or code are all very welcome :-) If you've got an idea for a big change drop me an email so we can coordinate work.

**Notice: this, the original and canonical version of gorilla-repl, is quite stable and will remain as such. However, in the interest of collaborative expediency, it would be best if issues and pull requests were raised at one of the maintainers' fork [here](https://github.com/benfb/gorilla-repl).**
